# Project-AI-Football-Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts football match outcomes based on historical data. Currently using a Random Forest model with ~52% accuracy.

What this project featured:

    Data cleaning and encoding of historical match data
    Random Forest classifier trained on past results
    Function to predict outcomes for new matchups
    A bunch of dumb stuffs that somehow work
    A grid-search that take a few minutes to run
    A whole bunch of codes made with blood and tears (and some broken table pieces)

What I learned from doing this project:

    Handling messy sports data and encoding categorical features
    Training and tuning a Random Forest model with GridSearchCV
    Evaluating accuracy and thinking about how to add better features
    Reinforced basic syntax

What to expect in the future:

    Add new features like ELO ratings and recent form
    Compare more models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Networks)
    Build a simple interface to let users input matches and see predictions
    Maybe make it more readable

How to run:

    git clone https://github.com/ImNotThatPro/Project-AI-Football-Predictor
    cd Project-AI-Football-Predictor
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    
    NOTE: IF ALL ELSE FAIL DON'T BLAME ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT IM DOING
